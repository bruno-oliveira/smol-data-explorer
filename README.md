A data model exploration tool built with `smolagents` - query your database in plain English!

## Why smol-data-explorer?

The potential of agents and agentic workflows in the current AI landscape is all the rage right now! With more and more announcements, blog posts, ideas, and also concerns, it's hard to not be talking or hearing about agents.

But, what is actually, being done "in the wild", that can be seen as truly useful for existing contexts?

Smol Data Explorer aims to be one of the infinite possible answers to the question above, by giving true "agency" to an LLM, we can do incredible things, and, this repo is just a small example of many amazing things that are possible, and, don't forget, this is as limited as this technology will be and it will only get better from here!

## So, what is it?

In a nutshell, imagine giving an LLM workflow the seamless ability to interact with your data "hands-on": you specify a DB schema, and, if there is a DB in your agent's running environment that knows and uses that schema, your agent can translate plain English questions into executable queries that unlock more insights on your data!
